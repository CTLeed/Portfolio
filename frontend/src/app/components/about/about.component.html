  <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
    Hi! I'm a full-stack developer with a strong passion for backend systems and clean, scalable code. I graduated from Coding Dojo in 2022 and am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Western Governors University to deepen my technical foundation.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
    My current project is <strong>BloomMap</strong>, a tool designed for small and micro flower farmers to track planting and blooming schedules, while also mapping out their gardens for better planning and functionality. It's a passion project that combines my love of technology with real-world problem-solving for growers.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
    I hold certifications in <strong>Linux Essentials</strong> and the <strong>ITIL 4 Foundation</strong>, and I'm always exploring better ways to build reliable, efficient systems. When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning about open-source tools, automating workflows, and occasionally getting my hands dirty helping in the garden.
